                <!-- <p>Yeshivat Simchas HaTorah is a very unique yeshiva for students aged 13-18. While catering to boys from high quality homes who have strong learning abilities and aspirations to grow spiritually, the Yeshiva will also benefit those who wish to explore other subjects and fields of interest in order to enrich their educational experience. The Yeshiva’s main focus is the study of Torah, Gemara and Halakhah, with a particular emphasis on lessons that will promote middot tovot and character development. The vocational studies and full matriculation exams that the school offers are designed to provide the students with a set of skills that will enable them to succeed in their field of choice. </p>
                <p>The Yeshiva’s mission statement and curriculum were developed after thorough and meticulous consultations with Roshei Yeshiva, Rabbonim and master educators. The daily structure is modeled after the classic yeshiva ketana schedule with rigorous Limudei Kodesh studies in morning. The afternoons will have the addition of general studies which will broaden the boys experience and expose them to other fields with practical applications. The Yeshiva will continue to provide educational assistance to the boys after their graduation and it is our goal that they will successfully join the yeshiva gedolah system. </p>
                <p>The raison d’etre of the Yeshiva is to provide the proper environment so that every young man can cultivate his own unique strengths and talents. The Yeshiva will foster the development and growth of its students and will equip them with the tools necessary for self-actualization and the achievement of practical goals. It is our hope that with the combination of our high educational standards and our dedicated and nurturing staff, your sons will reach their true potentials as Ovdei HaShem and productive members of society.</p> -->
